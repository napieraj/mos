/*
 * mos_config.c — pure, bounds-safe iteration over a GET CONFIGURATION
 * (MMC) response buffer.
 *
 * No IOKit. The IOKit shell issues GET_CONFIGURATION into a fixed,
 * zero-initialized buffer and hands that buffer plus the byte count it
 * trusts (sizeof the buffer — the MMC convenience GetConfiguration
 * returns no realized-transfer count) to the walker below. Every length
 * in the payload is device-reported and therefore hostile; this file is
 * the choke point that keeps those lengths from steering a read outside
 * [buf, buf+len).
 *
 * Layout (MMC-6 §5.2, GET CONFIGURATION response):
 *
 *   Feature header (8 bytes):
 *     [0..3] Data Length      (BE) — bytes of data available AFTER this
 *                                    field; total response = 4 + value.
 *     [4..5] Reserved
 *     [6..7] Current Profile  (BE)
 *   Feature descriptors, each:
 *     [0..1] Feature Code     (BE)
 *     [2]    (Version<<2) | (Persistent<<1) | Current
 *     [3]    Additional Length — feature bytes that follow; the
 *            descriptor spans 4 + Additional Length bytes total.
 *
 * Safety contract (the device controls every length here):
 *   - `len` is the only trusted ceiling. The header Data Length can only
 *     SHRINK the walked region (clamped under `len`), never extend it.
 *   - A descriptor is decoded only if its 4-byte header AND its
 *     Additional-Length payload fit within the trusted region.
 *   - A malformed Additional Length (not a multiple of 4, per MMC) ends
 *     the walk rather than desyncing it onto misaligned bytes.
 *   - The cursor advances by span >= 4 on every yield, so the walk makes
 *     forward progress and terminates in <= len/4 steps; a single-byte
 *     Additional Length cannot wrap the cursor.
 *   - The bool return is intentionally undifferentiated: false means
 *     "stop" — end of list OR a malformed/over-long descriptor, alike.
 *     Callers walk this as a plain `while (next(...))`; the malformed
 *     branch is unreachable on conformant hardware.
